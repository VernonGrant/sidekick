Sidekick is an **Emacs extension** that's aim is to provide useful information
about a symbol inside a single window. It's still in it's infancy, and at this
point in time only provides basic reference information. It will however be in
active development and I hope to extend it in the near future to support things
such as getting a symbols documentation and extracting other time saving
information.

If you experience any issues or there's a feature you would like to recommend,
please open a [New Issue](https://github.com/VernonGrant/sidekick.el/issues/new).

#### Current Feature List

- Finds matching symbols in the current buffer.

installed and available in your system path.
