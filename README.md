# Sidekick

Sidekick is a Emacs extension that's aim is to provide useful information about
a symbol inside a single panel. It's currently in it's infancy, and only
provides basic symbol information. I will be extending Sidekick in the near
future to support things such as symbol documentation and implementation
previewing.
